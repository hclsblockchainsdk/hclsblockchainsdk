# Open Healthcare & Life Sciences Blockchain SDK

Many aspects of today's healthcare systems face several systemic challenges such as complex and inefficient processes, lack of interoperability, data silos, fraud and abuse, lack of transparency and so on. Decentralized (distributed ledger) blockchain technology, as opposed to traditional centralized technology systems, has the potential to reduce opacity and friction, to bring more transparency and fluidity to multiparty transactions, to unlock new sources of revenue for various constituents, and to bring industry-wide transformation to the healthcare ecosystem. 

Developers can use the `Open HealthCare-LifeScience Blockchain SDK` to greatly reduce the barrier of entry, reduce development time and resources and accelerate solution and application development in healthcare and life sciences.
